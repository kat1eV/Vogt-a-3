Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?

I created a study group with and had the ability to talk with Cecchi Samuels and Negin Mansoori. 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?

I attended Johanna's office hours at 8:15 Thursday 9/28. I was unable to attend TA hours this week

- What are your initial impressions of Java?

I used to be vaguely familiar with Java.script, so i assumed it wouldnt be hard to adjust to the new language but i was VERY MUCH mistaken. It's been difficult taking the ideas in my head and translating them to syntax for Java.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

Although this was talked about in class also, I feel that Java is much more complex to understand from just looking at its program when compared to Python wich is relatively easier to understand when looking at it's syntax

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

What worked for me was reaching out to friends with experience in CS, classmates and Professors for general advice on how to approach the assignment (i.e. to have a good mindset, write down ideas before trying to code it, etc.) as well as ongoing encouragement from my professors!
    I get very easily overwhelmed when I feel that im not equipped to do an astounding job on something that will affect my grades, but ive been assured that with repeated practice, Java will only come easier, and that we can resubmit assignments after in hopes of a better grade once I know more.

Added after attending office hours with Johanna on 9/28;

    I feel a lot more confident about approaching what i have left to program. Johanna advised that I try adding pseudo code into my program rather than only writing on scratch paper, in order to have a better step-by-step handle on programming A-3. This has helped me trmendously with my confidence for this project.
